thanks for the comments
I have modified the simple-action.yml and now the action runs without errors
I have added dvc dag screenshot for the required files.

In the model building I don't know why you didn't pass this rubric. The rubric exactly says I complete the functions and the script should "..takes in the data, processes it, trains the model, and saves it and the encoder". No metrics saved for the test data.
ALso the rubric following it why you didn't pass it ??. I already implemented the three unit tests and you said in the comment that I did it "You implemented three tests that check for the expected return type of your functions." 

I have added the metrics in model card.

The most important step is the creation of the API. I did as what you said and included the Field example instead of  the Body examples. 
first, Now I don't know how to insert multiple examples with this Field you said. I was able to do it easily with the body. so what is the solution to this Field you suggested??
second, I added the param you said in the config part of the post request "allow_population_by_field_name = True". It did not solve the problem. I still can't apply the alias to what is passed to the post request. 
I still pass them like "native_country" instead of "native-country". 

for the next rubric. I added the dict data as suggested.

I have fixed the heroku app and now it's up and running. added the live_get.png screenshot.

So to sum it up. I still need help in the alias part to pass the argument as "native-country" not "native_country"
